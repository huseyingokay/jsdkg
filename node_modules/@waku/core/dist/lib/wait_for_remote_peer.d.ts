 * Wait for a remote peer to be ready given the passed protocols.

 * {@link @waku/create.createLightNode}.
 *
 * If the passed protocols is a GossipSub protocol, then it resolves only once
 * a peer is in a mesh, to help ensure that other peers will send and receive
 * message to us.
 *
 * @param waku The Waku Node
 * @param protocols The protocols that need to be enabled by remote peers.
 * @param timeoutMs A timeout value in milliseconds..
 *
 * @returns A promise that **resolves** if all desired protocols are fulfilled by
 * remote nodes, **rejects** if the timeoutMs is reached.
 * @throws If passing a protocol that is not mounted
 * @default Wait for remote peers with protocols enabled locally and no time out is applied.
